# Kyphosis

This Capstone project was originally completed as part of the "Practical Data Wrangling with Pandas" guided project course taught by instructor Ryan Ahmed through Coursera.com. The goal was to perform a basic Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the dataset. 

The data used in this project was the [Kyphosis Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abbasit/kyphosis-dataset?resource=download) and was originally uploaded on Kaggle.com, by user Abdul Basit, for public use.
